  details: Adele Goldberg is a computer scientist who participated in the development
    of the programming language Smalltalk-80 and various concepts related to object-oriented
    programming while a researcher at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, PARC, in
    the 1970s. Goldberg began working at PARC in 1973 as a laboratory and research
    assistant, and eventually became manager of the System Concepts Laboratory where
    she, Alan Kay, and others developed Smalltalk-80, which both developed the object-oriented
    approach of Simula 67 and introduced a programming environment of overlapping
    windows on graphic display screens. Not only was Smalltalk's innovative format
    simpler to use, it was also customizable and objects could be transferred among
    applications with minimal effort. Goldberg and Kay also were involved in the development
    of design templates, forerunners of the design patterns commonly used in software
    design.

  details: Beatrice Trixie Helen Worsley was the first female computer scientist
    in Canada. She received her Masters degree in mathematics from Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology in 1946 and her Ph.D. from Cambridge University. Early in 1949 she
    was sent to Cambridge University to gain experience on the EDSAC which was then
    nearing completion. The EDSAC was first demonstrated in May of that year and an
    account of the first demonstration including flow diagrams, programs and output
    - a table of primes from 5 to 1021 and a table of squares and first differences
    of the integers from 1 to 32 - may be found in (Worsley, 1949). When the Ferut
    was installed, she was one of the persons who wrote Transcode, a programming system
    which allowed programmers to write programs in a simplified language that was
    then compiled into Ferut's quite arcane machine language (Hume and Worsley, 1955).
    Trixie continued her studies at Cambridge and received a Ph.D. in 1952. She was
    possibly the first woman to obtain a doctorate in the field of computers. She
    continued at the University of Toronto for some years eventually becoming an Associate
    Professor.

  details: Frances Elizabeth Betty Holberton was one of the six original programmers
    of ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer. Holberton was
    born Frances Elizabeth Snyder in Philadelphia in 1917. On her first day of classes
    at the University of Pennsylvania, Holberton's math professor asked her if she
    wouldn't be better off at home raising children. During World War II while the
    men were fighting, the Army needed the women to compute ballistics trajectories.
    Holberton was hired by the Moore School of Engineering to work as a computor,
    and was soon chosen to be one of the six women to program the ENIAC. Classified
    as subprofessionals, Holberton, along with Kay McNulty, Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth
    Lichterman, Betty Jean Jennings, and Fran Bilas, programmed the ENIAC to perform
    calculations for ballistics trajectories electronically for the Ballistic Research
    Laboratory (BRL), US Army. Their work on ENIAC earned each of them a place in
    the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame. In the beginning, because
    the ENIAC was classified, the women were only allowed to work with blueprints
    and wiring diagrams in order to program it.

    and River Raid), Meninsky was one of two female engineers at Atari to develop
    video game cartridges released in the early 1980s. Meninsky's Atari 2600 credits
    include the award-winning 1980 racing game Dodge 'Em (also sold as Dodger Cars
    by Sears) and 1981's Warlords, a port of Atari's 1980 coin-op of the same name.
    Meninsky also worked on the 2600 port of Star Raiders (originally designed by
    Doug Neubauer and released in 1979 for the Atari 8-bit family of computers) and
    an unreleased prototype of Tempest. Meninsky's mother was a programmer and Carla
    learned programming in high school, but she switched from mathematics to neuropsychology
    and brain modelling at Stanford University. Given her artistic bent, Meninsky
    was particularly interested in vision and eventually veered back toward programming
    and a lifelong dream of creating animation tools. She presented her animation
    idea to Atari and was hired, but in the fluid environment characteristic of an
    early start-up, her talents were soon put to video game programming.

    Originally an Atari employee, Carol Shaw is said to be the first female video game designer (for her unreleased Polo game in 1978, and 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe game in 1979). Later she joined Activision, where she programmed her best-known game, River Raid.  According to the manual of River Raid, she is also a “scholar in the field of Computer Science.” With Keith Brewster she worked on the Atari Basic Reference Manual.
    Carol Shaw left Activision in 1984 after designing Happy Trails for the Intellivision and River Raid for the Atari 800 and Atari 5200. Her other credits include Checkers in 1981 and 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe in 1980 for the Atari 2600. She also worked on Super Breakout. Shaw lives in California, and is now retired and married to Ralph Merkle, a researcher in nanotechnology. Born in 1955, Shaw was born and raised in Palo Alto, California. Her father was a mechanical engineer and worked at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Shaw first became interested in computers in high school when she used a computer for the first time and discovered she could play text-based games on the system. Shaw attended UC Berkeley and graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1977. She went on to complete a master's degree in Computer Science at Berkeley.

    Hall of Fame in 2008. Hoover was born on June 19, 1926 in Irvington, New Jersey.
    Her family lived in South Orange, New Jersey and her father was a dentist and
    her mother was a teacher. She had a younger brother who died from polio at the
    age of five. She loved swimming, sailing, canoeing, and was interested in science
    at an early age. According to one source, she read the biography of Marie Curie
    which suggested to her that she could succeed in a scientific field despite the
    prevailing ideas about gender roles at the time. Hoover attended Wellesley College
    where she studied classical and medieval philosophy and history. She graduated
    from Wellesley in 1948 with honors, earning a bachelors degree, and she was inducted
    into Phi Beta Kappa and was honored as a Durant Scholar. She received a Ph.D.

  details: Evelyn Boyd Granville was one of the first African-American women to receive
    a Ph.D. in mathematics; she earned it in 1949 from Yale University. Evelyn Boyd
    was born in Washington, D.C.; her father worked odd jobs but separated from her
    mother when Boyd was young. Boyd and her older sister were raised by her mother
    and aunt, who both worked at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. She was valedictorian
    at Dunbar High School, which at that time was a segregated but academically competitive
    school for black students in Washington. With financial support from her aunt
    and, later, a small partial scholarship from Phi Delta Kappa, Boyd entered Smith
    College in the fall of 1941. She majored in mathematics and physics, but also
    took a keen interest in astronomy. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and to Sigma
    Xi and graduated summa cum laude in 1945. Encouraged by a graduate scholarship
    from the Smith Student Aid Society of Smith College, she applied to graduate programs
    in mathematics and was accepted by both Yale University and the University of
    Michigan; she chose Yale because of the financial aid they offered. There she
    studied functional analysis under the supervision of Einar Hille, finishing her
    doctorate in 1949. Her dissertation was On Laguerre Series in the Complex Domain.
    In 1950, she took a teaching position at Fisk University, a college for black
    students in Nashville, Tennessee (more prestigious postings being unavailable
    to black women). Two of her students there, Vivienne Malone-Mayes and Etta Zuber
    Falconer, went on to earn doctorates in mathematics of their own. But by 1952
    she left academia and returned to Washington with a position at the Diamond Ordnance
    Fuze Laboratories. After four years there she moved to IBM as a computer programmer;
    at IBM, she moved from Washington to New York City in 1957. She married the Reverend
    Gamaliel Mansfield Collins in 1960 and with him moved to Los Angeles, where she
    worked for the U.S. Space Technology Laboratories, then in 1962 the North American
    Aviation Space and Information Systems Division, and then IBM again. Forced to
    move because of a restructuring at IBM, she took a position at California State
    University, Los Angeles in 1967 as a full professor of mathematics. She married
    realtor Edward V. Granville in 1970. After retiring from CSULA in 1984 she taught
    at Texas College in Tyler, Texas for four years, and then in 1990 joined the faculty
    of the University of Texas at Tyler as the Sam A. Lindsey Professor of mathematics.
    There she developed elementary school math enrichment programs.

  title: Frances Spence
  details: Frances Spence was one of the original programmers for the ENIAC computer.
    She was born Frances Bilas in Philadelphia in 1922. She attended Temple University
    but then was awarded a scholarship to Chestnut Hill College. She majored in mathematics
    with a minor in physics and graduated in 1942. While there, she met Kathleen McNulty,
    who also later became an ENIAC programmer. Although one of the original programmers
    of the ENIAC, her role as well as the other woman contributors were downplayed,
    due to the stigma that woman didn't like technology. McNulty and Spence were hired
    by the Moore School of Engineering to compute ballistics trajectories. Both were
    selected to become part of the first group of programmers for the ENIAC, which
    was designed to perform the same calculations. In 1947, she married Homer Spence,
    an Army electrical engineer from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds who had been assigned
    to the ENIAC project and later became head of the Computer Research Branch. Shortly
    after that, she resigned to raise a family.

  title: Gertrude Blanch
  details: Gertrude Blanch (ca. 1897 - 1996) was an American mathematician who did
    pioneering work in numerical analysis and computation. Blanch was born Gittel
    Kaimowitz in Kolno, Poland, arrived in the United States as a child, and attended
    public schools in New York City. She spent fourteen years as a clerk, saving money
    for school. She received a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics, with a minor
    in Physics, from New York University in 1932. She received her Ph.D. from Cornell
    University in algebraic geometry in 1935. For a while she worked as a substitute
    teacher at Hunter College; then, in 1938, she began work on the Mathematical Tables
    Project of the WPA, for which she was Director of Mathematics and Manager of
    Computation. This entailed designing algorithms that were executed by teams of
    human computers under her direction. Many of these computers possessed only rudimentary
    mathematical skills, but the algorithms and error checking in the Mathematical
    Tables Project were sufficiently well designed that their output defined the standard
    for transcendental function solution for decades. This project later became the
    Computation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards. The Mathematical Tables
    Project became an independent organization following the termination of the WPA
    at the end of 1942. During World War II, it operated as a major computing computing
    office for the US government and did calculations for the Office for Scientific
    Research and Development, the Army, the Navy, the Manhattan Project and other
    institutions. Blanch led the group throughout the war.

    Navy rear admiral. A pioneer in the field, she was one of the first programmers
    of the Harvard Mark I computer, and invented the first compiler for a computer
    programming language. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming
    languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first modern programming
    languages. She is credited with popularizing the term debugging for fixing computer
    glitches (inspired by an actual moth removed from the computer). Owing to the
    breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to
    as Amazing Grace. The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) is named for her,
    as was the Cray XE6 Hopper supercomputer at NERSC.

  title: Grete Hermann
  details: Grete (Henry-)Hermann was a German mathematician and philosopher noted
    for her work in mathematics, physics, philosophy and education. She is noted for
    her early philosophical work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, and is now
    known most of all for an early, but long-ignored refutation of a no-hidden-variable
    theorem by John von Neumann. The disputed theorem and the fact that Hermann's
    critique of this theorem remained nearly unknown for decades are considered to
    have had a strong influence on the development of quantum mechanics. Hermann studied
    mathematics at Göttingen under Emmy Noether, where she achieved her Ph.D. in 1926.
    Her doctoral thesis, Die Frage der endlich vielen Schritte in der Theorie der
    Polynomideale (in English The Question of Finitely Many Steps in Polynomial
    Ideal Theory), published in Mathematische Annalen, is the foundational paper
    for computer algebra. It first established the existence of algorithms (including
    complexity bounds) for many of the basic problems of abstract algebra, such as
    ideal membership for polynomial rings. Hermann's algorithm for primary decomposition
    is still in use now.

  title: Hedy Lamarr
  details: Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-born American actress and inventor. After an
    early film career in Germany, Lamarr moved to Hollywood at the initiation of MGM
    head, Louis B. Mayer, where she soon became a star during MGM's Golden Age.
    Max Reinhardt, who directed her in Berlin, called her the most beautiful woman
    in Europe, having strikingly dark exotic looks, a sentiment widely shared by
    her audiences and critics. She garnered a degree of fame and notoriety after starring
    in the Czech director Gustav Machatý's Ecstasy, a 1933 film which featured closeups
    of her acting during orgasm in one scene, as well as full frontal nude shots of
    her in another scene. Her most popular success was as the biblical temptress Delilah
    in Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah (1949). Lamarr was also notable as co-inventor,
    with composer George Antheil, of an early technique for spread spectrum communications
    and frequency hopping, which paved the way for today's wireless communications
    and which, upon its invention in 1941, was deemed so vital to national defense
    that government officials would not allow publication of its details. At the Electronic
    Frontier Foundation's Sixth Pioneer Awards in 1997, she and George Antheil were
    honoured with special awards for their trail-blazing development of a technology
    that has become a key component of wireless data systems.

  title: Ida Rhodes
  details: |-
    Ida Rhodes was a mathematician who became a member of the clique of influential women at the heart of early computer development in the United States. Ida Rhodes (birth name Hadassah Itzkowitz) was born in a Jewish village between Nemyriv and Tulchyn in the Ukraine. She came to the United States in 1913 and was studying mathematics at Cornell University only six years later. She received her BA in mathematics in February, 1923 and her MA in September of the same year, graduating Phi Beta Kappa. She later studied at Columbia University in 1930 and 1931. Rhodes held numerous positions involving mathematical computations before she joined the Mathematical Tables Project in 1940, where she worked under Gertrude Blanch, whom she would later credit as her mentor. She was a pioneer in the analysis of systems of programming, and with Betty Holberton designed the C-10 programming language in the early 1950s for the UNIVAC I. She also designed the original computer used for the Social Security Administration. In 1949, the Department of Commerce awarded her an Gold Medal for significant pioneering leadership and outstanding contributions to the scientific progress of the Nation in the functional design and the application of electronic digital computing equipment. Though she retired in 1964, Rhodes continued to consult for the Applied Mathematics Division of the National Bureau of Standards until 1971. Her work became much more widely known after her retirement, as she took the occasion to travel around the globe, lecturing and maintaining international correspondence. In 1976, the Department of Commerce presented her with a further Certificate of Appreciation on the 25th Anniversary of UNIVAC I, and then at the 1981 Computer Conference cited her a third time as a UNIVAC I pioneer. She died in 1986. In an unusual case of an old specialized algorithm still in use, and still credited to the original developer, Rhodes was responsible for the Jewish Holiday algorithms used in calendar programs to this day.

    vice president of Honeywell, Inc. She was a systems thinking tutor and was the
    first female CIO of Honeywell. In 1945, Wyman received a Regents Scholarship and
    was accepted into the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan as
    one of seven female students. To supplement her scholarship, she worked as a switchboard
    operator and waitress. At the time, women in engineering programs received little
    encouragement and support. While her grades qualified her for membership in Tau
    Beta Pi, the engineering honor society, she received only a Women's Badge, since
    the society did not admit women at the time. Wyman graduated with a Bachelor of
    Sciences/EM degree in 1949. While still a junior in college, Wyman worked on a
    missile guidance project at the Willow Run Research Center. To calculate trajectory,
    they used mechanical calculators. She visited a Navy research facility that was
    working on similar problems, and discovered they were using a prototype of a programmable
    computer that had been developed at Harvard University. She became interested
    in computers and later recalled that I became an enthusiastic pioneer in this
    new technology and it led to my life's career. After graduation, she joined a
    start-up company that was eventually acquired by Honeywell Information Systems.
    She moved to Minneapolis and began a long management career at Honeywell, eventually
    serving as Chief Information Officer. She became vice president of Honeywell Corporate
    Information Management (CIM) before retiring in 1990. Wyman then began a second
    career as archdeacon in the Minnesota Diocese of the Episcopal Church where she
    coached servant leadership, retiring again after ten years as Archdeacon of the
    Diocese of Minnesota. Wyman supported research and planning as a thought leader
    in futures studies. As an aside to this, she contended to an interviewer in 1979,
    that it's just as important to know when to ignore all the careful planning and
    seize an opportunity. Wyman endowed the Irma M. Wyman Scholarship at the University
    of Michigan's Center for the Education of Women to support women in engineering,
    computer science and related fields.

    and books that encourage girls to explore technology and inventions. Her toy inventions
    include the Snoop Stopper Keepsake Box, Me-Mail Message Center, Zap N’ Lock Journal,
    Yak Bak, and Swap-It Locket. Her publications include Tech Girl''s Internet Adventures,
    Tech Girl''s Activity Book, and Girlzine: A Magazine for the Global Girl. In the
    late 1980s, Swanson was hired by Brøderbund Software as a product manager, where
    she helped develop The Treehouse, The Playroom, and the Macintosh edition of the
    game Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?. She invented gadgets for her daughter,
    including a voice recording device that she hoped to install in Jackie''s day
    care cubby and in her own office. I missed her so much that I used to call my
    home answering machine to hear her voice, and I thought this would let me talk
    to her during the day. In 1992 she left Brøderbund to develop a follow-on device
    that electronically altered a voice''s pitch and modulation, which she licensed
    to Yes! Entertainment (which marketed it as the Yak Bak), and to Tiger Electronics
    for its Talkboy FX. In 1995 Swanson decided that she wanted to create toys aimed
    specifically at girls, and founded Girl Tech as an independent company with headquarters
    near her home in San Rafael, California. Products included the Friend Frame
    talking picture frame, the Keepsafe storage box with a remote-controlled lock,
    and a remote listening device called Bug ''Em. Swanson claimed that her vision
    for the company did not match the expectations of existing toy distributors: For
    two years after I founded the company, toy store buyers would say, ''Can you make
    it pink?'' ''Can''t you make it for boys?'' And I would say, ''No, this is what
    girls like to play with.'' She later sold the company to Radica Games, now a
    division of Mattel, for $6 million. She has also licensed her technologies to

  details: 'Jean Bartik was one of the original programmers for the ENIAC computer.
    In 1945, the Army was recruiting math majors for the war effort; her faculty adviser
    noticed a job advertisement for an Army project in Philadelphia and suggested
    Bartik apply. She was hired by the University of Pennsylvania to work for Army
    Ordnance at Aberdeen Proving Ground to calculate ballistics trajectories by hand
    as a human computer. While working there, Bartik met her husband, William Bartik,
    who was an engineer working on a Pentagon project at the University of Pennsylvania.
    They married in 1946 and divorced in 1968. When the Electronic Numeric Integrator
    and Computer (ENIAC) was developed for the purpose of calculating these same trajectories,
    Bartik applied to become a part of the project and was eventually selected to
    be one of its first programmers. Bartik and the other five original programmers
    became extremely adept at running the ENIAC, after learning how the machine worked
    only by reviewing diagrams of the device and by talking to its engineers: there
    was no manual. Initially, they were not allowed to see the ENIAC at all since
    it was still classified and their clearance hadn''t gone through, so they had
    to learn how to program the machine solely through schematic diagrams. Bartik
    later became part of a group charged with converting the ENIAC into a stored program
    computer: in the original implementation, ENIAC was programmed by setting dials
    and changing cable connections. After the end of the war, she went on to work
    with the ENIAC designers John Eckert and John Mauchly, and helped them develop
    the BINAC and UNIVAC I computers. Recalling her time working with Eckert and Mauchly,
    she described their close group of computer engineers as a technical Camelot.
    In 1951, the same year the UNIVAC was introduced, Bartik left the industry to
    raise her three children. '

  title: Kathleen Booth
  details: 'Kathleen Booth (née Britten) is credited with writing the first assembly
    language and the design of the assembler and autocode (ARC and APE(X)C) for the
    first computer systems at Birkbeck College, University of London. Kathleen Booth
    worked at Birkbeck College from 1946–62. She traveled to the United States as
    Andrew Booth''s research assistant in 1947, visiting with John von Neumann at
    Princeton. Upon returning to the UK, she co-authored General Considerations in
    the Design of an All Purpose Electronic Digital Computer, describing modifications
    to the original ARC redesign to the ARC2 using a von Neumann architecture. Part
    of her contribution was the ARC assembly language. She also built and maintained
    ARC components. Kathleen and Andrew Booth''s team at Birkbeck were considered
    the smallest of the early British computer groups. From 1947 to 1953, they produced
    three machines: ARC (Automatic Relay Computer), SEC (Simple Electronic Computer),
    and APE(X)C (All-purpose Electronic (Rayon) Computer). This was considered a remarkable
    achievement due the size of the group and the limited funds at its disposal. Although
    APE(X)C eventually led to the HEC series manufactured by the British Tabulating
    Machine Company, the small scale of the Birkbeck group did not place it in the
    front rank of British computer activity. Booth regularly published papers concerning
    her work on the ARC and APE(X)C systems and co-wrote Automatic Digital Computers
    (1953) which illustrated the ''Planning and Coding'' programming style. She co-founded
    the School of Computer Science and Information Systems in 1957, along with Andrew
    Booth and J.C. Jennings. In 1958, she taught a programming course. In 1958, Booth
    wrote a book describing how to program APE(X)C computers.'

  details: Kathleen Kay McNulty Mauchly Antonelli (12 February, 1921 – 20 April
    2006) was one of the six original programmers of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose
    electronic digital computer. A week or two after graduating, she happened to see
    a US Civil Service ad in The Philadelphia Inquirer looking for women with degrees
    in mathematics. During World War II, the US Army was hiring women to calculate
    bullet and missile trajectories at The Ballistic Research Laboratory, which had
    been established at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, with staff
    from both the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the Moore School of Engineering at the
    University of Pennsylvania. She immediately called her two fellow math majors,
    Frances Bilas and Josephine Benson about the ad. Benson couldn't meet up with
    them, so Kathleen and Fran met in Philadelphia one morning in June 1942 for an
    interview in a building on South Broad Street (likely the Union League Building).
    One week later, they were both hired as human computers at a pay grade of SP-4,
    a subprofessional civil service grade. They were notified to report to work at
    the Moore School of Engineering. Their job was to compute ballistics trajectories
    used for artillery firing tables, mostly using mechanical desk calculators and
    extremely large sheets of columned paper. The pay was low, but both Kathleen and
    Fran were satisfied to have attained employment that used their educations (having
    had no prior employment experience) and that served the war effort.

    Workbench was meant to help students learn to edit their work: My feeling about
    a lot of those tools is their value in education is as much pointing out to people
    who are learning to write that they have choices and make choices when they do
    it. They don’t think of a writing task as making choices per se. Once they get
    it on paper they think it’s cast in stone. So it makes them edit. Cherry also

    research on number theory. Upon discovering that her results had already been
    proven by the work of Robert Carmichael and L. E. Dickson, she abandoned mathematics
    to focus on poetry. However, she was convinced to return to mathematics by her
    friend, László Kalmár, who suggested she research the work of Kurt Gödel on the
    theory of incompleteness. She prepared her own, different proofs to Gödel''s work.
    Péter presented the results of her paper on recursive theory, Rekursive Funktionen,
    to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich, Switzerland in 1932.
    For her research, she received her PhD summa cum laude in 1935. In 1936, she presented
    a paper entitled Über rekursive Funktionen der zweite Stufe to the International
    Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo. These papers helped to found the modern field
    of recursive function theory as a separate area of mathematical research. In 1937,
    she was appointed as contributing editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic. After
    the passage of the Jewish Laws of 1939 in Hungary, Péter was forbidden to teach
    because of her Jewish origin and was briefly confined to a ghetto in Budapest.
    During World War II, she wrote her book Playing with Infinity: Mathematical Explorations
    and Excursions, a work for lay readers on the topics of number theory and logic.
    Originally published in Hungarian, it has been translated into English and at
    least a dozen other languages. With the end of the war in 1945, Péter received
    her first full-time teaching appointment at the Budapest Teachers’ Training College.
    In 1952, she was the first Hungarian woman to be made an Academic Doctor of Mathematics.
    After the College closed in 1955, she taught at Eötvös Loránd University until
    her retirement in 1975. She was a popular professor, know as Aunt Rózsa to her
    students. In 1951, she published her key work, Recursive Functions (Rekursive
    Funtionen). She continued to publish important papers on recursive theory throughout
    her life. In 1959 she presented a major paper Über die Verallgemeinerung der
    Theorie der rekursiven Funktionen für abstrakte Mengen geeigneter Struktur als
    Definitionsbereiche to the International Symposium in Warsaw (later published
    in two parts in 1961 and 1962). Beginning in the mid-1950s, Péter applied recursive
    function theory to computers. Her final book, published in 1976, was Recursive
    Functions in Computer Theory. Originally published in Hungarian, it was translated
    into English in 1981.'

  title: Roberta Williams
  details: Roberta Williams is an American video game designer, writer and a co-founder
    of Sierra On-Line (later known as Sierra Entertainment), who developed her first
    game while living in Simi Valley, California. She is most famous for her pioneering
    work in the field of graphic adventure games with titles such as Mystery House,
    the King's Quest series, and Phantasmagoria. She is married to Ken Williams and
    retired from her career in 1999. Roberta Williams is considered one of the most
    influential PC game designers of the eighties and nineties, and has been credited
    with creating the graphic adventure genre. In the 1980s and 1990s, Roberta and
    her husband, Ken Williams, were leading figures in the development of graphical
    adventure games. In 1980, they founded the company On-Line Systems, which later
    became Sierra On-Line. The first Williams' title was Mystery House (1980), which
    became known as the first graphical adventure game. The second title, Wizard and
    the Princess (1980), added color graphics. But the first serious success was the
    King's Quest series, which featured a large expansive world that could be explored
    by players. After that, Roberta Williams designed such titles as Mixed-Up Mother
    Goose (1987), The Colonel's Bequest (1989), and Phantasmagoria (1995), which was
    the first in her career to be developed in the full-motion video technology. Phantasmagoria
    featured extreme violence and rape scenes. The game has received mixed reviews.
    Though Sierra was sold in 1996, Williams' production credits date to 1999, when
    she retired from Sierra On-Line. Roberta posed for the cover of the game Softporn
    Adventure by Chuck Benton, published by On-line Systems. She also posed much later
    with her children as Mother Goose for the cover photograph of Mixed-Up Mother
    Goose. The end sequence of Leisure Suit Larry 3 features her as an in-game character.
    In a 2006 interview, Williams said that designing computer games was in the past
    for her then and that she intended to write a historical novel. However, in 2011,
    the video game website Gamezebo reported that Roberta Williams was working on
    a social network game Odd Manor.

    her work on Internet congestion control, and is one of the top-ten most cited
    researchers in computer science. Dr. Floyd received a BA in Sociology from the
    University of California - Berkeley in 1971. She received an MS in Computer Science
    in 1984 and a PhD in 1987, both from UC - Berkeley. Floyd is best known in the
    field of congestion control as the inventor of Random Early Detection (RED)
    active queue management scheme, thus founding the field of Active Queue Management
    (AQM) with Van Jacobson. Almost all Internet routers use RED or something developed
    from it to develop data paths between different networks. Floyd devised the now-common
    method of adding jitter to message timers to avoid synchronization. Floyd, with
    Vern Paxson, in 1997 identified the lack of knowledge of network topology as the
    major obstacle in understanding how the Internet works. This paper, Why We Don't
    Know How to Simulate the Internet, was re-published as Difficulties in Simulating
    the Internet in 2001 and won the IEEE Communication Society's William R. Bennett
    Prize Paper Award. Floyd is also a co-author on the standard for TCP Selective

  details: 'Sandra Kurtzig is an American businesswoman and technology entrepreneur.
    She was one of Silicon Valley''s first female entrepreneurs, and as the founder
    of the business and manufacturing software producer ASK Group in 1972, was the
    first woman to take a Silicon Valley technology company public. Kurtzig earned
    a Bachelor''s degree in mathematics from University of California, Los Angeles,
    and a Master''s degree in aeronautical engineering at Stanford University. In
    1972, she quit her job selling computer time-sharing for General Electric and
    devoted more of her time to starting a family. She founded ASK Group as a part-time
    job, using $2,000 of her own savings. Kurtzig wasn''t able to give up working
    completely and launched a small, part-time contract software-programming business
    out of her second bedroom to keep her mind occupied and increase her income,
    never intending the business to operate outside her house. She was asked to create
    an inventory-tracking program that could efficiently provide manufacturing information
    by her first client. Realizing that other manufacturers might find such a program
    useful, she recruited several graduates with degrees in engineering and computers.
    They wrote standardized applications that addressed problems faced by local manufacturers
    under her direction. Initially, the start-up received no interest from venture
    capitalists, so she instead launched ASK Group on her retained earnings. Her company
    required access to minicomputers and she persuaded employees at a nearby Hewlett-Packard
    plant to allow her company to use one of the company''s HP 3000 minicomputers
    outside of normal working hours. By 1978, ASK released a package of programs called
    Manman, one of the first enterprise resource planning (ERP) software suites. She
    later concluded a deal for Hewlett Packard to sell Manman for use on HP3000 minicomputers,
    at a time when most ERP software was only available to run on more expensive mainframe
    computers. The company went public on NASDAQ in 1981, and in 1983, Kurtzig''s
    personal stake in the ASK Group was worth $67 million. At its peak, the company''s
    annual sales revenue was 450 million US dollars. She resigned from her role CEO
    of ASK Group in 1985. In 2010 she founded the enterprise management software company
    Kenandy, where she is currently the chairman and CEO. Kenandy is named after Kurtzig''s
    sons, Ken and Andy, who are serving as CEOs at other tech businesses. In June
    2013, Kenandy announced a $33 million round of funding led by Lightspeed Venture
    Partners. Kurtzig''s autobiography, CEO: Building a $400 Million Company from
    the Ground Up was published by Harvard Business Press.'

    computer scientist. She is known for designing the Acorn Micro-Computer, the first
    of a long line of computers sold by Acorn Computers Ltd, as well as the instruction
    set of the ARM processor. Wilson studied computer science and the Cambridge Mathematical
    Tripos at the University of Cambridge. In 1978, she designed the Acorn Micro-Computer,
    the first of a long line of computers sold by Acorn Computers Ltd. In 1981, Wilson
    extended the Acorn Atom's BASIC programming language dialect into an improved
    version for the Acorn Proton, a microcomputer that enabled Acorn to win the contract
    with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for their ambitious computer education
    project, whereupon the Proton became the BBC Micro and its BASIC was developed
    into BBC BASIC. In 1983, she designed the instruction set for one of the first
    RISC processors, the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM), later to become one of the most
    successful IP cores (i.e., a licenced CPU core) of the 1990s and 2000s. Wilson
    designed Acorn Replay, the video architecture for Acorn machines. This included
    the operating system extensions for video access as well as the codecs themselves,
    optimised to run high frame rate video on ARM CPUs from the ARM 2 onwards. Wilson
    was a member of the board of the technology and games company Eidos plc, which
    bought and created Eidos Interactive, for the years following its flotation in
    1990, and was a consultant to ARM Ltd when it was split off from Acorn in 1990.
    Since the demise of Acorn Computers, Wilson has made a small number of public
    appearances to talk about her time there. Wilson is now the Director of IC Design
    in Broadcom’s Cambridge, UK office. She was the Chief Architect of Broadcom's
    Firepath processor. Firepath has its history in Acorn Computers, which, after
    being renamed to Element 14, was bought by Broadcom in 2000. She was listed in
    2011 in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article entitled The 15 Most Important Women
    in Tech History. She was awarded the Fellow Award by the Computer History Museum

  title: Thelma Estrin
  details: Thelma Estrin, a 1977 IEEE Life Fellow for contributions to the design
    and application of computer systems for neurophysiological and brain research,
    is a pioneer in the field of biomedical engineering and as the IEEE's first female
    vice president. Thelma was born in New York City, an only child who was destined
    to attend college and attain greater achievements. While other girls in school
    took commercial courses, she pursued academic courses and prepared to go to college.
    She attended City College of New York (CCNY) in 1941 where she met her husband
    Gerald Estrin. A year later, in 1942, she took a three month course at Stevens
    Institute of Technology for engineering assistants. She worked for two years at
    the Radio Receptor Company. In 1946 she and Jerry moved to Madison, Wisconsin,
    to pursue undergraduate electrical engineering degrees at the University of Wisconsin.
    Through a great deal of hard work and long days, Thelma Estrin received her B.S.,
    M.S. and Ph.D. in 1948, 1949 and 1951, respectively. Jerry received an offer to
    join John von Neumann's computer project at the Institute for Advanced Study and
    they moved to Princeton, NJ. Thelma was determined to maintain her own career
    and was hired at the Electroencephalography Department of the Neurological Institute
    of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital (New York) in November 1951. Thelma and Jerry
    spent fifteen months in Israel working on the WEIZAC (WEIZmann Automatic Computer).
    This became the first electronic computer in the Near East, and is now an IEEE
    Mielstone in Electrical and Computer Engineering (in the 1980s, the WEIZAC team
    was interviewed for the Computer Pioneers Project). In 1960, Thelma joined the
    Brain Research Institute (BRI) and in 1970 became the Director of its Data Processing
    Laboratory. As Director she provided computer support for a variety of research
    projects and helped dozens of researchers make use of computers. Thelma was an
    early champion of medical informatics, the application of computers to medical
    research and treatment, in all its branches. In 1980 Thelma became a professor
    in residence in the Computer Science Department of the School of Engineering and
    Applied Science at UCLA. She retired in July 1991 at the age of sixty-seven. Thelma
    has been an active IEEE volunteer, serving as an officer of the IEEE Engineering
    in Medicine and Biology Society and on the Technical Activities Board, and she
    was the first woman to be elected to the IEEE Board of Directors. In 1982 she
    served as executive vice president of IEEE. She has received many honors from
    the Institute, including the Haradan Pratt Award in 1991.

Returning to Mexico City in 1927, he engaged in teaching and research in physiology. In 1930, he obtained a Guggenheim Scholarship and moved to Harvard University, to work in the department of Physiology, then directed by Walter Cannon. With Cannon he explored the chemical mediation of homeostasis. Rosenblueth cowrote research papers with both Cannon and Norbert Wiener, pioneers of cybernetics. Notably he was the lead author for the 1943 article 'Behavior, Purpose and Teleology' that was co-written by Wiener and Julian Bigelow and which was published in Philosophy of Science. Rosenblueth was an influential member of the core group at the Macy Conferences.

  title: Walter Pitts
  details: Walter Harry Pitts, Jr.  was an American logician who worked in the field of computational neuroscience. He proposed landmark theoretical formulations of neural activity and generative processes that influenced diverse fields such as cognitive sciences and psychology, philosophy, neurosciences, computer science, artificial neural networks, cybernetics and artificial intelligence, together with what has come to be known as the generative sciences. He is best remembered for having written along with Warren Sturgis McCulloch, a seminal paper in scientific history, titled A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity (1943). This paper proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network. The unit of this model, a simple formalized neuron, is still the standard of reference in the field of neural networks. It is often called a McCulloch–Pitts neuron. Prior to that paper, he formalized his ideas regarding the fundamental steps to building a Turing machine in The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics in an essay titled Some observations on the simple neuron circuit.

His writings include Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972) and Mind and Nature (1979). In Palo Alto, California, Bateson and in these days his non-colleagues developed the double-bind theory of schizophrenia. Bateson's interest in systems theory forms a thread running through his work. He was one of the original members of the core group of the Macy conferences in Cybernetics (1941–1960), and the later set on Group Processes (1954–1960), where he represented the social and behavioral sciences. He was interested in the relationship of these fields to epistemology. His association with the editor and author Stewart Brand helped widen his influence.

  details: Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider is known simply as J. C.

He is particularly remembered for being one of the first to foresee modern-style interactive computing and its application to all manner of activities; and also as an Internet pioneer with an early vision of a worldwide computer network long before it was built. He did much to initiate this by funding research that led to significant advances in computing technology, including today's canonical graphical user interface, and the ARPANET, which is the direct predecessor of the Internet. Robert Taylor, founder of Xerox PARC's Computer Science Laboratory and Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center, noted that most of the significant advances in computer technology—including the work that my group did at Xerox PARC—were simply extrapolations of Lick's vision. They were not really new visions of their own. So he was really the father of it all.

Partly as a result of Shockley's attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the 1950s and 1960s, California's Silicon Valley became a hotbed of electronics innovation. He recruited brilliant employees, but quickly alienated them with his autocratic and erratic management; they left and founded major companies in the industry.

  title: Douglas Engelbart
  details: Douglas Carl Engelbart was an American engineer, inventor, and a pioneer in many aspects of computer science. He is best known for his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the computer mouse,[a] and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces. These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. Engelbart's law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.

  title: B.F. Skinner
  details: Burrhus Frederic Skinner was an American psychologist, behaviorist, inventor, and social philosopher. He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University from 1958 until his retirement in 1974. Skinner developed behavior analysis, especially the philosophy of radical behaviorism, and founded the experimental analysis of behavior, a school of experimental research psychology. He also used operant conditioning to strengthen behavior, considering the rate of response to be the most effective measure of response strength. To study operant conditioning, he invented the operant conditioning chamber (aka the Skinner box), and to measure rate he invented the cumulative recorder. Using these tools, he and Charles Ferster produced Skinner's most influential experimental work, outlined in their 1957 book Schedules of Reinforcement.

  title: André-Marie Ampère
  details: André-Marie Ampère was a French physicist and mathematician who was one of the founders of the science of classical electromagnetism, which he referred to as electrodynamics. He is also the inventor of numerous applications, such as the solenoid (a term coined by him) and the electrical telegraph. As an autodidact, Ampère was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and professor at the École polytechnique and the Collège de France. The SI unit of electric current, the ampere (A), is named after him. His name is also one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. The term kinematic is the English version of his cinématique, which he constructed from the Greek κίνημα kinema (movement, motion), itself derived from κινεῖν kinein (to move).

  title: Alessandro Volta
  details: Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta was an Italian chemist and physicist who was a pioneer of electricity and power, and is credited as the inventor of the electric battery and the discoverer of methane. He invented the voltaic pile in 1799, and reported the results of his experiments in a two-part letter to the president of the Royal Society, which was published in 1800. With this invention, Volta proved that electricity could be generated chemically and debunked the prevalent theory that electricity was generated solely by living beings. Volta's invention sparked a great amount of scientific excitement and led others to conduct similar experiments, which eventually led to the development of the field of electrochemistry.

  title: Charles Babbage
  details: Charles Babbage is a mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer. Babbage is considered by some to be father of the computer. He is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the difference engine, that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in his analytical engine, programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom. As part of his computer work, he also designed the first computer printers. He had a broad range of interests in addition to his work on computers covered in his 1832 book Economy of Manufactures and Machinery. He was an important figure in the social scene in London, and is credited with importing the scientific soirée from France with his well-attended Saturday evening soirées. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as pre-eminent among the many polymaths of his century.

  title: Michael Faraday
  details: Michael Faraday was an English chemist and physicist who contributed to the study of electrochemistry and electromagnetism. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and electrolysis. Although Faraday received little formal education, as a self-made man, he was one of the most influential scientists in history. It was by his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics. Faraday also established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena. He similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and the laws of electrolysis. His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became practical for use in technology. The SI unit of capacitance, the farad, is named after him.

  details: Herman Hollerith was a German-American statistician, inventor, and businessman who developed an electromechanical tabulating machine for punched cards to assist in summarizing information and, later, in accounting. His invention of the punched card tabulating machine, patented in 1884, marks the beginning of the era of mechanized binary code and semiautomatic data processing systems, and his concept dominated that landscape for nearly a century. Hollerith founded a company that was amalgamated in 1911 with several other companies to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. In 1924, the company was renamed International Business Machines (IBM) and became one of the largest and most successful companies of the 20th century. Hollerith is regarded as one of the seminal figures in the development of data processing.

  details: John Romulus Brinkley was an American quack doctor, broadcaster, marketer and independent politician. He had no accredited education as a physician and bought his medical degree from a diploma mill. Brinkley became known as the goat-gland doctor after he achieved national fame, international notoriety, and wealth through the xenotransplantation of goat testicles into humans. Although Brinkley initially promoted this procedure as a means of curing male impotence, he later claimed that the technique was a virtual panacea for a wide range of male ailments. Brinkley operated clinics and hospitals in several states and was able to continue practicing medicine for almost two decades, despite his techniques being thoroughly discredited by the broader medical community.
